# Final Project

This full-stack application, is the last project at Technigo' Spring 2024 Web Development Bootcamp,
this is a realistic simulation of an imaginary hotel.
It enables users to book one of the available rooms based on their selected arrival and departure dates.
To complete a booking, users must register or log in if they already have an account.
Once logged in, users can view their registered bookings and delete their accounts if desired.

## The problem

Although we have learned a lot during the boot camp, we are still fairly junior developers. This final project has been a valuable challenge, allowing us to demonstrate the new skills and work methodologies we have acquired in web development. We still have much room to grow, both on the frontend and especially on the backend, where the logic and code can be particularly challenging when the results are not immediately visible.
Even though we are really proud and happy of what we have achived on this last three weeks.
